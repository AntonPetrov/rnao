# RNA Ontology

The central aim of the [RNA Ontology Consortium](http://roc.bgsu.edu) (ROC) is to develop an ontology
to capture all aspects of RNA - from primary sequence to alignments, secondary and tertiary structure, and 
from base pairing and base stacking interactions to sophisticated motifs.

RNA Ontology is described in the publication by [Hoehndorf et al., 2011](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1971674.1971676).
