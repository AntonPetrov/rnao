#summary Essential RNAO terminology

==Auxiliary terms and definitions==
===Nucleic Acid Structure===
The structural conformation of a nucleotide can be in part described by its torsion angles. The phosphodiester linkage (backbone) has six characteristic angles: α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ, the furanose has five torsions: θ,,0,, through θ,,4,,, and the glycosidic bond χ describes the remaining torsion angle (Figure 1).

*Figure 1* : RNA backbone with six torsion angles, the glycosidic torsion angle χ and the five torsion angles of the furanose (θ,,0,, through θ,,4,,). 

Figure 1 depicts the δ and θ,,1,, torsions on the same covalent bond C3'-C4', but from different endpoints, respectively C2' and O4' for θ,,1,,, and C5' and O3' in the phosphodiester chain for δ. The glycosidic torsion, χ, is measured respectively in purines and pyrimidines from atoms 04'-C1'-N9-C4 and O4'-C1'-N1-C2.

The furanose ring stereochemistry imposes interdependent relations on θ,,0-4,,, which is expressed by the cosine function:

            θ,,j,, = θ,,max,,cos(ρ + jφ)            *(1)*
where j=0...4 and φ = 144°(720°/5).


When  j=0, we have:
            θ,,0,, = θ,,max,,cos(ρ)                 *(2)*

In equations 1 and 2, ρ is the pseudorotation of the ribose ring. Note that when ρ is varied from 0 to 360° by steps of 90°, θ,,0,, goes from θ,,max,, to 0, to -θ,,max,, to 0, and finally back to θ,,max,,. The θ,,max,, value is reached twice, at the initial conformation (ρ = 0, as cos(0) = 1) and at ρ = 360°. at each step of ρ + 180°, the sign of all torsions is inversed, corresponding to the mirror image of the conformation at ρ. Equation 1 can also be expressed in terms of ρ:

===Ontology terms===
*Continuant*: An entity that exists in full at any time in which it exists at all, it persists through time while maintaining its identity and has no temporal parts. 

*Independent Continuant*: A continuant that is the bearer of qualities and realizable entities. For example: a nucleic acid, a protein, a region of a cell.

*Dependent Continuant*: A continuant that is an attribute of the independent continuant that bears it. For example: the mass of a molecule, the functional role of a protein.

*Quality*: An intrinsic dependent continuant whose observed/measured value may change with time. For example: The mass of a molecule, the number of atoms in a protein.

*Fiat Object Part*: An independent continuant that is part of an object but is not demarcated by any physical discontinuities. For example: The part of the cell that is involved in cell adhesion.

==Taxonomy of Terms==

* Quality: 
 * Conformation: *The quality of shape based on geometry*.
  * Nucleotide Conformation: *A conformation of the nucleotide based on the rotation of the base across the glycosidic torsion angle χ.*
    * Syn Conformation: *The syn conformation characterizes a nucleobase oriented towards the ribose. From χ = 0°, where the plane of the base is aligned with the O4’-C1’ bond in a direction towards the O4’ atom, the syn conformation covers the remaining rotations of ±90°: χ = [-90°, 90°]*
    * **Anti Conformation**: *The anti conformation characterizes a base oriented away from the ribose. From χ = 180°, where the plane of the base is aligned with the O4’-C1’ bond in a direction away from O4’, the anti conformation covers a rotation of ±90°: χ = [-180°, -90°] and χ = [90°, 180°]*
  * **Furanose Conformation:** 
    * **Pucker Conformation**:* A furanose conformation characterized by the set of their torsion angles: θ0-4.*
      * **Envelope Conformation**: *A furanose conformation in which only one of the five furanose atoms  (C1’, C2’, C3’, C4’ or O4’) is out of the plane formed by the four others.
        * *^3^E conformation (C3’-endo)* : For ρ = [18°,36°[, the furanose forms an envelope with the C3’ atom above the plane.
        * *^2^E conformation (C2’-endo)* : The furanose forms an envelope with the C2' atom above the plane.
        * *,,4,,E conformation (C4' -exo)*: For ρ = [54°,72°[, the furanose forms an envelope with the C4' atom below the plane. 
      * *Twist Conformation*: A furanose conformation in which two atoms are in opposite sides of the plane formed by the remaining three.*
        * ^3^T,,2,, conformation (C3'-endo - C2'-exo): *At ρ = 0°, the furanose is in the twist shape with the C3’ atom above (endo) and the C2’atom below (exo) the plane*
        * **^3^T,,4,, conformation (C3'-endo - C4' -exo)**: *For ρ = [36°,54°[, the furanose is in the twist conformation with C3' atom above (endo) and the C4' atom (exo), below the plane*.
