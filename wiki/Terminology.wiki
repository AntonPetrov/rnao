#summary Essential RNAO terminology

- terms & definitions.

Hierarchically Organized

* Quality
 * Conformation: *The quality of shape based on geometry*.
  * Nucleotide Conformation: *A conformation of the nucleotide based on the rotation of the base across the glycosidic torsion angle χ.*
    * Syn Conformation: *The syn conformation characterizes a nucleobase oriented towards the ribose. From χ = 0°, where the plane of the base is aligned with the O4’-C1’ bond in a direction towards the O4’ atom, the syn conformation covers the remaining rotations of ±90°: χ = [-90°, 90°]*
    * **Anti Conformation**: *The anti conformation characterizes a base oriented away from the ribose. From χ = 180°, where the plane of the base is aligned with the O4’-C1’ bond in a direction away from O4’, the anti conformation covers a rotation of ±90°: χ = [-180°, -90°] and χ = [90°, 180°]*
  * **Furanose Conformation:** 
    * **Pucker Conformation**:* A furanose conformation characterized by the set of their torsion angles: θ0-4.*
      * **Envelope Conformation**: *A furanose conformation in which only one of the five furanose atoms  (C1’, C2’, C3’, C4’ or O4’) is out of the plane formed by the four others.
        * *^3^E conformation (C3’-endo)* : For ρ [18°,36°[, the furanose forms an envelope with the C3’ atom above the plane.
        * *^2^E conformation (C2’-endo)* : The furanose forms an envelope with the C2' atom above the plane.
        * *,,4,,E conformation (C4' -exo)*: For ρ [54°,72°[, the furanose forms an envelope with the C4' atom below the plane. 
      * *Twist Conformation*: A furanose conformation in which two atoms are in opposite sides of the plane formed by the remaining three.*
        * ^3^T,,2,, conformation (C3'-endo - C2'-exo): *At ρ = 0°, the furanose is in the twist shape with the C3’ atom above (endo) and the C2’atom below (exo) the plane*
        * **^3^T,,4,, conformation (C3'-endo - C4' -exo)**: *For ρ [36°,54°[, the furanose is in the twist conformation with C3' atom above (endo) and the C4' atom (exo), below the plane*.
