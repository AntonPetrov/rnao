#summary Motifs for RnaO discussion

= Introduction =

These are motifs that we would like to agree on definitions for.

= Motifs =
== A minor RNA motif (SO:0000022) ==
SO def: "A region forming a motif, composed of adenines, where the minor groove edges are inserted into the minor groove of another helix." [SO:ke]

== hammerhead ribozyme (SO:0000380) ==
SO def: "A small catalytic RNA motif that catalyzes self-cleavage reaction. Its name comes from its secondary structure which resembles a carpenter's hammer. The hammerhead ribozyme is involved in the replication of some viroid and some satellite RNAs." [http://rnaworld.bio.ku.edu/class/RNA/RNA00/RNA_World_3.html]

== asymmetric RNA internal loop (SO:0000021) ==
SO def: "An internal RNA loop where one of the strands includes more bases than the corresponding region on the other strand." [SO:ke]

== K turn RNA motif (SO:0000023) ==
SO def: "The kink turn (K-turn) is an RNA structural motif that creates a sharp (~120 degree) bend between two continuous helices." [SO:ke]

== sarcin like RNA motif (SO:0000024) ==
SO def: "A loop in ribosomal RNA containing the sites of attack for ricin and sarcin." [http:////proton.chem.yale.edu/pdf/7897662.pdf]

== symmetric RNA internal loop (SO:0000025) ==
SO def: "An internal RNA loop where the extent of the loop on both stands is the same size." [SO:ke]

== RNA junction loop (SO:0000026) ==
no SO def.

== RNA hook turn (SO:0000027) ==
no SO def.
